// Alternating Coin Game
// • Given sequence of n coins of value v0, v1,...,vn 1
// • Two players (“me” and “you”) take turns
// • In a turn, take first or last coin among remaining coins
// • My goal is to maximize total value of my taken coins, where I go first
// • First solution exploits that this is a zero-sum game: I take all coins you don’t
